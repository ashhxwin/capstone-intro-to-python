# Capstone Project: Introduction to Computer Programming

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This capstone project is designed to evaluate understanding and practical application of core programming concepts in Python. It includes a series of challenges focusing on:

- Data types, indexing, slicing
- Operators and in-built functions
- Control flow: conditionals and loops
- Functions and custom logic
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception handling
